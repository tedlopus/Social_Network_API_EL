## Description

This social network API is like any other but instead of using SQL it uses Mongoose. The social network allows you to see all the users, update a user, as well as create and delete a user. The social network also allows you to see all the thoughts from all users, update a user's thought, as well as create and delete a user's thought. You can add and delete friends from users. You can also add and delete reactions from users' thoughts. All of this data is stored in MongoDB under usersDB and thoughtsDB.

## Installation

Installation steps for if you are running this application locally:

1. Open up the terminal
2. Type out "npm i" to install all the packages and dependencies
3. Then type "npm start" which will run the scripts required to start the http://localhost:3001 and the mongo database.

## Usage

The usage from this app is all backend and is viewed through the applications Insomnia and MongoDB Compass. In Insomnia we are able to test the routes and the json data that is inputted and deleted. There are a total of 14 routes that can be tested: 4 Get Routes, 4 Post Routes, 4 Delete Routes, and 2 PUT Routes. You can view the inputted JSON data in MongoDB Compass as they are inputted and updated in Insomnia. The HTML page will show nothing since this strictly backend database research.
